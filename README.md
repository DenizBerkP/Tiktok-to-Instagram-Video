This project downloads TikTok videos from predetermined links and shares them as reels videos on Instagram at the desired times.


*I used the **instagrapi** library to log in to Instagram.*

*I used the **selenium** library to download Tiktiok videos.*

*I used the **pyperclip** library for copy to clipboard video links.*


After installing the necessary libraries, you can use them by filling in the fields with the description text in the code as appropriate.

**WARNING** Make sure you don't have any important videos in your downloads folder. The code content deletes previous videos in Downloads folder before downloading new videos.
